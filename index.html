    <p>I think the topics or AI and Data Science are really interesting. 
    I found out recently about this product that github working on that basically <strong>auto-generates</strong> software.
    It is an AI called <strong>Co-Pilot</strong> and it is able to make an educated guess as to what youre trying to make based of context.
    This includes variable symbols, syntax and everything else. Github <strong>and</strong> stackoverflow are both owned by
    <strong>Microsoft</strong> so there is a large database of code for various languages for them to work with. Im very exited to 
    see what other things computer are capable of with ML.</p>
